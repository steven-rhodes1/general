file contains many aliases used. 

Other automations, such as command completion, are included. You may need to install those reference packages or remove the reference. These are tools I use regularly. These command completion commands are kept here to keep my ~/.zshrc as minimal and factory as possible.

Place below command at end of ~/.zshrc
source ~/.aliases.zsh
